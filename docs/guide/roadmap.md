# Project Roadmap

This document tracks large features on the engineering roadmap. This is not an authoritative document - we have internal project management and roadmaps. It's mainly here to reduce questions.

**Note:** It should not be assumed that the architecture is 'set' based on this roadmap. We have many other features that might appear down the road.

## Planned Features

- [ ] AWS C series support
- [ ] SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing)
- [ ] ESX hypervisor support
- [ ] Hyper-V hypervisor support

## Feature Development
