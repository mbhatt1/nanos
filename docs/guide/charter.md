# Project Charter

## Mission

Authority Nanos is a security kernel for autonomous agents, enabling safe, auditable execution of AI agents in production environments.

## Tenets

These tenets guide Authority Nanos' development:

### 1. Security

Authority Nanos aims to be a much more secure system than Linux. It achieves this through several approaches:

- **Unikernel architecture** - Single-process design eliminates multi-user complexity and privilege escalation vectors
- **Minimal kernel** - Reduces attack surface by limiting code
- **Capability-based security** - Fine-grained access control with cryptographic tokens
- **Audit logging** - Hash-chained, tamper-evident logs of all operations

### 2. Minimalism (KISS)

Keep It Simple, Stupid. As Authority Nanos is not intended to run on bare metal, we strive to keep the core as simple as possible while maintaining security guarantees.

### 3. Performance

Efficiency in both execution and resource usage, without sacrificing security principles.

## Contributions & Project Roles

All contributions must align with this charter:

- Changes should enhance security, simplicity, or performance (in that priority order)
- Security invariants are non-negotiable
- Code should be minimal and maintainable
- Documentation should be clear and comprehensive

For contribution guidelines, see [Contributing](./contributing.md).
