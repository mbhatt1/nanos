"""
Authority Nanos Python SDK setup configuration.

This module configures the installation and distribution of the Authority Nanos
Python SDK, which provides Python bindings for the libak authorization kernel.

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC WHEELS SUPPORT
=================================

This setup.py builds platform-specific wheels that include pre-compiled libak binaries
for the current platform. This enables binary distribution without requiring compilation
on end-user systems.

Supported Platforms:
  - macOS x86_64 (10.9+)
  - macOS ARM64 (11.0+)
  - Linux x86_64 (manylinux2014)
  - Linux ARM64 (manylinux2014)

BUILD PROCESS
=============

1. Before building wheels, ensure libak binaries are present in the build artifacts:
   - output/platform/macos-x86_64/libak.dylib
   - output/platform/macos-arm64/libak.dylib
   - output/platform/linux-x86_64/libak.so
   - output/platform/linux-arm64/libak.so

2. The setup.py automatically detects available binaries and includes them in wheels
   for the current platform.

3. Binary loading is handled by authority_nanos/_libak_loader.py which:
   - Detects the current platform (OS + architecture)
   - Locates and loads the bundled libak binary
   - Falls back to system libak if needed
   - Provides clear error messages if the binary is not found

MANIFEST.in Configuration
==========================

The MANIFEST.in file specifies which binary files to include in the source distribution
and wheels. This ensures that wheels built on different platforms include their
respective platform-specific binaries.

WHEEL PLATFORM TAGS
====================

Platform-specific wheels are tagged with:
  - macosx_10_9_x86_64
  - macosx_11_0_arm64
  - manylinux2014_x86_64
  - manylinux2014_aarch64

This prevents pip from installing incompatible wheels on different platforms.
