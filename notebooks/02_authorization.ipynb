    "# Authorization and Capabilities in Authority Nanos\n",

    "This notebook explains the capability-based authorization system in Authority Nanos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Capability-Based Authorization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional security systems use **access control lists (ACLs)** - asking \"who is allowed to do what?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Authority Nanos uses **capabilities** - unforgeable tokens that grant specific permissions. Think of it like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ACL**: \"Show me your ID to prove you can enter\"\n",
    "- **Capability**: \"Here's a key that opens this specific door\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Grant only the permissions needed\n",
    "2. **No Ambient Authority** - Can't accidentally use permissions you shouldn't\n",
    "3. **Delegation** - Can pass capabilities to sub-agents\n",
    "4. **Audit Trail** - Every capability use is logged\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how this works!"
